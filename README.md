# custom-message-in-rss-feed
This Plugin allows you to insert custom messages at the start or the end of your blog entry in your RSS feed. Can be useful to put in source links if proper attribution is not being given to your content which is syndicated. You can also put in a small logo or icon of your blog which could link back to your site.
